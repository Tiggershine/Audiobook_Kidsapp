# Overview

This project is for **UI/UX development of Audiobook**, which is the part of **Kidsapp** developed as part of a software lab course. Because it is an application targeting children users, we predicted how children would react with our UI. So, we focused on making it easy for children to operate, and made a colorful design that children could like.

## Book Series

- The image, title, and duration of each book are displayed in advance.


## My List

- Provides a page where user can save a list of their favorite books.
- It displays the last played audiobook and provides a UI to continue playing.


## Player

- In addition to basic audio functions (play, forward, rewind, etc.), it displays the book's cover and series number.
- In a static environment with only audio, a moving background was used to arouse children's interest.
- User can play forward or backward with sliding.
