# Overview

This project is for **UI/UX development of Audiobook**, which is the part of **Kidsapp** developed as part of a software lab course. Because it is an application targeting children users, we predicted how children would react with our UI. So, we focused on making it easy for children to operate, and made a colorful design that children could like.
